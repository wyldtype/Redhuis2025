# Network analysis with Barkai Lab Expression Compendium
### Data from Krieger et al. 2020 Genome Research
### Heavily using Langfelder, Horvath, and Zhang's Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis R package (WGCNA)

Goal: Compare gene-gene co-expression networks between two species of yeast, *S. cerevisiae* and *S. paradoxus*

## R scripts (main folder)
Scripts are roughly belonging to 3 categories:

#### 1) Data cleaning/network construction
-organizing data into formats required for downstream analysis then outputting these formats as .RData files (in data\_files folder)
- ex) clean\_barkai\_data.R and all network\_construction R scripts

#### 2) Network analysis
- accepts WGCNA-generated networks and performs various analyses on them
- ex) network\_analysis.R, network\_gene\_swaps.R

#### 3) Non-network analysis
- usually accepts DEseq data sets
- ex) duplicate\_enrichment.R, differential\_expression.R

## Data files
Also 3 categories:

#### 1) Primary data, generated by outside sources
- ex) Barkai expression compendium

#### 2) Networks RData files
- WGCNA networks generated by different parameters

#### 3) Other RData files
- generated in R scripts within the repository, but not using WGCNA

## Archive
All scripts no longer being used in analyses, potentially containing some useful code snippets for reference

## Plots
All plots generated in R scripts

## Gene ontology
2 categories:

#### 1) Lists of gene names for input into GO tools (such as the one on Saccharomyces Genome Database)

#### 2) Output from GO tools

Note: All .RData, .xlsx, .csv, .txt data files are currently un-tracked so they won't appear on github
